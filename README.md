to get all of the frames just do a git clone. The frame pngs should be in the frames folder.  
`git clone https://github.com/CrazyKitty357/bapple-gb.git`  
the video is rendered at 30 FPS if you feel like compiling the music video yourself.

Q: Why did you make this?  
A: <*insert bad apple music here*>  

Q: Seriously though why did you make this?  
A: I wanted to try to render bad apple on a gameboy via [gbstudio](https://gbstudio.dev), however the process of adding 6572 logo scenes would take forever so I just uploaded what I had so far which is mostly frame conversions.
